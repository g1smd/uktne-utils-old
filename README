The data source for this project is the nine column CSV
file that is output by the code that can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/ofcom-csverter/. That project
automatcially corrects errors found in Ofcom's data.

The uktne-utils project utilises some code from the
parsecsv-for-php project. That project can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/parsecsv-for-php/. That file is
used to import the CSV data into two arrays. Please see
that project for CSV-parsing code updates.

The uktne-utils project takes the data found in those two
arrays and it then builds the dataset in two new arrays
but using only three columns. The latest version of the
uktne-utils.lib.php file can be found at
http://github.com/g1smd/uktne-utils.

The new data can then be saved to a brand new CSV file
by using the parsecsv-for-php code for a second time.
The output is very similar to that shown in the file at
https://github.com/aubergene/UK-Telephone-Number-Extractor/blob/master/areas.csv.
